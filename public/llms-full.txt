## About Oracle Boxing

Oracle Boxing is an online boxing coaching company that teaches real boxing fundamentals to beginners worldwide. Founded by Oliver Betts and Jordan Lyne, the platform was created to solve a common problem: most people don't have access to quality boxing coaching. Local gyms often lack structured teaching methodology, and many aspiring boxers are intimidated by the gym environment.

Oracle Boxing delivers professional boxing instruction via live Zoom coaching calls, personalised video feedback, structured curriculum, and a supportive global community. The platform has trained over 500 members and maintains a 4.9/5 satisfaction rating.

The company is based online and serves members across all timezones with 11 live coaching classes per week.

## Coaching Methodology

**The 3 Pillars:** The curriculum is built around Stance, Shape, and Rotation - the three foundational elements that everything else in boxing builds upon. By mastering these fundamentals first, members develop correct habits from day one.

**Progressive Grade System:** The curriculum progresses through Grades. Grade 1 covers the absolute basics. Higher Grades build on the foundation with more advanced techniques, combinations, and skills. Members can take grading calls to assess their progress and advance.

**Research-Backed:** Oracle Boxing references peer-reviewed research on the physical and cognitive benefits of boxing training, including improvements in coordination, cardiovascular health, stress reduction, and cognitive function.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if I've never boxed before?**
Oracle Boxing is designed specifically for beginners. Whether you join the membership or the 21-Day Challenge, the curriculum starts from absolute zero and builds progressively. No prior experience is needed.

**How does online boxing coaching work?**
You join live Zoom coaching calls where coaches demonstrate techniques and watch you practice in real time. Between calls, you record yourself practicing and submit videos for personalised feedback. The combination of live instruction and video review provides a level of individual attention that most in-person gyms can't match.

**What equipment do I need?**
You need minimal equipment to start - just enough space to move and a device to join Zoom calls and record yourself. Specific equipment recommendations are provided when you enrol.

**Can I cancel my membership anytime?**
Yes. Both monthly and annual memberships can be cancelled at any time. Annual memberships are pro-rated based on usage.

**Is there a money-back guarantee?**
Yes. Oracle Boxing offers a money-back guarantee on the 21-Day Challenge. If you're not satisfied, you can request a refund.

**What's the difference between Monthly and Annual membership?**
Both include full access to all coaching, workouts, and community. The annual plan saves $267/year and includes the Boxing First Principles course and a free 1-on-1 coaching call.

**What timezones do you cover?**
With 11 live classes per week and coaches across different timezones, Oracle Boxing serves members worldwide. The coaching schedule covers mornings, afternoons, and evenings across major timezone regions.

**How is this different from YouTube boxing tutorials?**
YouTube videos are one-way - you watch, but no one watches you. Oracle Boxing provides live, interactive coaching with personalised feedback on YOUR technique. Coaches identify and correct YOUR specific issues, which is impossible with pre-recorded content.

**What are the 3 Pillars of Boxing?**
Stance (how you stand and move), Shape (how you hold your guard and throw punches), and Rotation (how you generate power through hip and shoulder movement). These are the foundations everything else in boxing builds upon.
