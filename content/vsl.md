VSL Plan: "The FASTEST Way to Get Good at Boxing in 2025"
1. Hook / Setup
Pain Point: "If you've ever walked out of training and thought 'I should be way better than this by now' - this video is for you."
Reality Check: "You're not progressing as fast as you expected, your technique still isn't up to scratch, and you're not getting the feedback that you actually need to improve."
Credibility: "I know this because I've felt exactly what you're feeling. I wanted to accelerate my progress faster than traditional methods allowed, so I've spent my entire boxing journey analyzing what actually works."
Channel Positioning: "If you watch this channel, you know how I break down boxing - from what's objectively true, not opinion. You don't want flashy gimmicks. You just want the core objective truths about how you should do something."
The Twist: "And I assume if you're watching this, you think like me. You understand that you need a system. You need the science. You need to train smarter, not just harder. So why don't we apply that same first-principles approach to the actual strategy of how we learn boxing?"
The Promise: "I've compiled all the metrics for all the different ways of learning boxing. We're going to bottom out, once and for all, what is actually the fastest way to get as good as possible."
Stakes: "Because if you don't have the right system, you'll spend the next year drilling bad habits that will take ten years to undo. The fundamentals you need will slip further away while you think you're making progress."
Transition: "So we're going through all the systems - all the different ways people learn boxing - and figure out which one is genuinely the fastest system. And I'm going to review each method in ascending order, from worst to best, so we can see exactly how they stack up."
2. The Scorecard Method
Setup: "Here's how we're going to figure this out. I've identified the 6 most important factors that determine how fast you actually get good at boxing. We're going to evaluate each learning method across these factors, then see which one comes out on top."
The 6 Categories Explained:
Feedback: How quickly and accurately you get corrected when you're doing something wrong. This is the most important factor - you can't improve what you can't see.
Time Invested: How much of your time gets wasted vs. how much actually contributes to your improvement. The more efficient your time, the more you can invest and exponentially improve faster.
Price: Not just the upfront cost, but what are you actually paying for each bit of progress? Plus the hidden cost of bad habits - paying money to learn things you'll have to pay even more to unlearn later.
Information Quality: Are you learning vague techniques they haven't questioned, or systematic first-principles? Is this opinion-based ("this worked for me") or grounded in biomechanics that actually works? Has this coach thought about what they're teaching from first principles, or are they just repeating what someone repeated to them?
Community Quality: Do you have access to other people who accelerate your learning? But here's the key - if the information quality is wrong, the community becomes an epistemic tribe that reinforces bad knowledge until it becomes gospel. You end up with entire gyms teaching the same flawed approach because they're all reinforcing each other's mistakes.
Sparring Access: Can you test what you're learning under pressure? But more importantly - and this is crucial - are you actually prepared when you do? Your body's natural tendencies to box are completely wrong, and if you keep sparring with those natural tendencies, you won't be able to get out of those bad habits. This is extremely common in gyms that don't have the other categories sorted - they throw you in unprepared and you actually get worse.
Method-by-Method Breakdown:
YouTube Self-Study
The Reality: "Free information overload with zero feedback loop - the worst of both worlds."
Feedback: 🔴 Non-existent - You have absolutely no idea if you're doing anything correctly
Time Invested: 🔴 Wasteful - Hours watching random videos with no systematic progression
Price: 🟢 Free - Look, it's free. You could argue that without feedback you're developing bad habits which costs you time, but we'll give YouTube this one
Information Quality: 🟢 Abundant - There's more boxing information on YouTube than any one person could teach you. Big channels generally have solid first-principles knowledge
Community Quality: 🔴 Non-existent - Comment sections and Reddit threads don't count as coaching
Sparring Access: 🔴 Disaster - You'll get destroyed because nothing you learned actually works under pressure
Local Boxing Gym
The Reality: "Most local gyms are businesses first, boxing gyms second. One coach managing 20-30 people in a class. The ones that aren't - the real fight gyms - are so hard to find and they're not really open for beginners to just walk in and start learning."
Feedback: 🟠 Limited - You might get "hands up" or "good job" but no real technical correction
Time Invested: 🟠 Inefficient - Lots of conditioning, less actual boxing skill development. There's not enough time in that one-hour session for everyone to get proper feedback, so they rely on fitness workouts instead
Price: 🟢 Good value - £50-100/month is decent value for what you get. Unless you're favored by a specific coach who's actually good, then you might be lucky and get great value, but that's unlikely
Information Quality: 🟠 Questionable - A lot of modern boxing teachers are actually just PE teachers. They focus on fitness over teaching the actual boxing skill. As Chris Eubank said, boxing coaches nowadays don't know what they're talking about - they don't know how to teach the actual art
Community Quality: 🟠 Variable - If it's a good gym focused on learning the art of boxing, it could be an amazing community. But most people coming from YouTube end up in commercial gyms with 20-30 people and coaches who don't really know what they're talking about. The community can only be as good as the information quality, and bad knowledge spreads fast in big classes
Sparring Access: 🟢 Available - You get variety of different skill levels to spar against, which is valuable for testing yourself. Yes, there are ego issues and it's more of a test than direct improvement, but this is where you're most likely to get actual sparring experience. [Note: Include Charli story - taking what he learned online and going to spar at gyms]
1-on-1 Personal Trainers
The Reality: "It's completely dependent on who the 1-on-1 is with. Anyone advertising personal training is there to make money, but here's how to tell if they're actually good: 1) What's their actual experience? 2) Can they spot and correct mistakes immediately? 3) Most importantly - does their feedback destroy your ego or blow smoke up your ass? If they're constantly correcting you, they probably know what they're talking about."
Feedback: 🟠 Variable - Best case: Constant feedback on every combination you throw, immediate corrections. Worst case: Just hold pads without any real feedback - basically an expensive pad workout
Time Invested: 🟢 Efficient - Always focused only on you, so this should always be good regardless of the coach
Price: 🔴 Variable but expensive - Best case: £40/hour to learn from someone world-class is worth it. Worst case: £40/hour for someone to just hold pads without teaching you anything - terrible value per improvement
Information Quality: 🟠 Variable - Best case: World-class coach making you improve rapidly. Worst case: They're constantly making you worse with bad habits
Community Quality: 🔴 Isolated - Always the same regardless - just you and the coach, no peer learning
Sparring Access: 🔴 Not authentic - You're only "sparring" with your coach in a controlled environment. It's not real sparring against someone trying to win - more like advanced pad work
Online Coaching (Structured Program)
The Reality: "Video feedback, live coaching calls, community support, and AI assistance. Most people haven't heard of online boxing coaching because they assume boxing has to be physical and in-person."
Feedback: 🟢 Excellent - Think CCTV - coaches can see everyone's full body in perfect view without walking around a gym. They can review 10 people in 30 seconds. You get recordings you can watch back, feedback attached to your videos, demonstrations recorded specifically for your mistakes. You can type a message instantly any time of day and get responses from multiple perspectives. It's like having a team of coaches available 24/7
Time Invested: 🟢 Highly efficient - You don't need to go anywhere. The knowledge is always with you. You can ask questions all the time. No travel, no waiting around, no wasted time on conditioning when you want to learn technique
Price: 🟢 Outstanding value - Same price as local boxing gyms (£50-100/month) but with all the additional benefits. You need literally just your body - no equipment, no fuel for your car, just shorts and a t-shirt. The value per improvement is unmatched
Information Quality: 🟢 Market-tested - No online coach can be successful without being good, because the market decides if they're successful. Local gyms become monopolies in their area with no alternatives, but online all the secrets are out there. You've got nothing to defend yourself against - you have to have the right knowledge or you won't get subscribers and no one will listen to you. Comments will destroy you if you don't know what you're talking about. You can tell who's legitimate by their audience size and response
Community Quality: 🟢 Accelerated learning - Think about your best friendships - they probably formed at university, not primary school. At school, you're stuck with whoever's nearby. At university, you choose from a massive pool based on actual compatibility and shared interests. Online coaching works the same way. Everyone's there because they see the world the same way as you, believe in the same things, want the same things. No bad apples because if you're here, it's because you chose this approach, not because it's just down the road. If the community has the ability to inspire a culture of coaching, it becomes one of the most powerful ways to spread knowledge - every member becomes a coach, knowledge spreads quickly, and beginners get taken care of immediately instead of being ignored
Sparring Access: 🟠 Prepared - You can't spar online, but you arrive at your local gym with proper fundamentals instead of learning bad habits under pressure. Plus, if the community is big enough, you can meet up with other members for sparring - which we actually have
The Winner is Clear: Online coaching dominates every category except sparring. But more importantly, it's the best method that has the ability to prepare you properly before you test yourself under pressure.
Context Note for Video: The people with real boxing knowledge generally aren't looking to make money - they want to make champions. We found one of those gems in our coach Dave. His only limitation was that he wasn't social media savvy. So we basically extracted all this knowledge that normally you'd have to spend 10 years in a dirty boxing gym to learn, and plastered it across social media. That's why our channel blew up - however you feel about that, it's just the reality.
Transition: "The numbers don't lie. But let me show you what this looks like in practice."
3. Proof (Transformations)
Student Transformations: Show what customers have managed to achieve through online coaching - transformation clips, before/after sparring footage, technique improvements.
Frame: "These aren't pros. They're regular people who thought they were starting too late. Online coaching helped them fast-track their skills."
Charlie's Sparring Story (The Missing Link): "But what about sparring? Let me tell you about Charlie. He learned purely online - knew nothing at all when he started. [Show before clip]. Then he went sparring at his local gym. The coaches couldn't believe what he'd achieved. They didn't understand how he'd managed to learn all this stuff without being there in person. That just goes to show how new and powerful this method is."
