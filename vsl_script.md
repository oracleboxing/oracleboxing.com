(0:00) If you've clicked on this video, it's probably because you want to get good at boxing (0:05) as fast as possible, by actually learning the real fundamentals. But the reality isn't matching your (0:13) expectations. Maybe you started late, maybe you keep freezing up in spa and getting beaten up (0:19) by kids half your size and there's nothing more humiliating than that.
You kind of know what to do (0:25) but your body just won't do it because no one's coaching you on the proper technique. (0:31) Now if any of that sounds familiar then this video is for you. I know that feeling (0:36) better than anyone because I've experienced the worst case scenario of every situation.
(0:43) I started boxing at 11. I'm 24 now so I've been around the sport for over a decade but for the (0:51) seven years I had no real support, no real coaching. I learned everything wrong and even (0:57) from a young age I got beaten up in sparring pretty regularly which just reinforced bad habits (1:03) and made me worse.
I got thrown into fights, I had no chance of winning and eventually I lost (1:10) motivation. I took random years out at a time and by the time I wanted to take boxing seriously (1:16) and finally found a coach who actually cared about my skill level instead of just throwing (1:21) me into tough spas to get brain damage, I was already in my early 20s and yet within just two (1:28) years I went from a low-level novice boxer with loads of reckless habits to competing at top (1:35) amateur competitions. That's how I know that there's a faster way because I've lived it.
(1:40) If you don't have consistent feedback from a reliable source, if you're thrown into sparring (1:46) at the wrong time and get beaten up by 14 year olds, if you keep walking out of training thinking (1:53) I just learned absolutely nothing that session, then I'm sorry but you're never going to get (1:58) good at boxing especially if you started late and already feel behind. That's why you need a system, (2:07) something that lets you catch up to the early starters and not just catch up but completely (2:12) surpass them in as little as six to twelve months and by the end of this video you'll see exactly (2:18) how you can flip that frustration into rapid progression. I got lucky, I found a coach with (2:25) real experience after the first seven years.
Over 70 fights himself and he created a national (2:32) champion previously. He had real boxing knowledge and the ability to actually explain it. I couldn't (2:38) throw a single punch without him shouting some emotionless critique, no compliments at all and (2:45) that's exactly what I was looking for.
He trained in old school gyms in London, Gloucester and the (2:51) West Country and he passed everything he'd learned straight down to me. But here's the problem, (2:56) finding a coach like that today is almost impossible. Most of that old school boxing (3:02) knowledge literally died out in the war and now pretty much anyone can go on a coaching course, (3:09) tick a few boxes and call themselves a boxing coach.
As Chris Eubanks said, boxing coaches are PE (3:16) teachers now. Fighters today are taught by PE teachers not fighters. PE teachers get men fit.
I (3:23) always hear in the gym you've got to get fit. No, you have to learn how to fight and only boxers can (3:28) teach that, not PE teachers. The real coaches, fighters who know how to teach, they're like gold dust.
(3:35) If you've got one, you're lucky. If you don't, you're kind of stuck because the truth is without (3:41) proper guidance, boxes don't just plateau, they usually get worse and that's why we've recently (3:48) opened the Oracle Boxing Gym where I'm sat right now but more on this in future videos. Having (3:54) learned the real fundamentals from my coach and put them to test in my 30 amateur fights, I've (4:00) managed to amass 200,000 subscribers and over 17 million views on YouTube in just over a year (4:06) with over half a million followers across all platforms and all of that is because me and my (4:12) coach took a first principles approach to boxing.
Now what the hell does that mean? It means we've (4:19) reasoned everything from what is most fundamentally true. As a competitive boxer myself, I'm always (4:25) looking at what's going to get me better as quickly as possible and my progression over the last (4:31) two to three years has proved that I might have found it. So here's what we're going to do in this (4:37) video.
To truly find the fastest way to learn boxing, we need to measure each of these methods (4:43) against six different categories. Sparring, does it prepare you properly for it so you can actually (4:49) learn? Feedback, is it consistent and accurate? Time invested, is it efficient, smart training or is (4:56) it just fitness? Price, is it affordable, good cost per rate of progress? Information quality, is it (5:04) from a reliable fight tested source? And finally community quality, is it well cultured pushing (5:10) you forward instead of just holding you back? If a method can hit all of those categories (5:16) then we found a system that can truly accelerate your progress. Oh and one more thing, I've personally (5:22) tried and tested every single one of these methods multiple times with multiple different sources.
(5:28) I've wasted years taking the beatings as you can see and lived through the frustration so you don't (5:35) have to. That sacrifice means when I tell you what works and what doesn't you can be confident that (5:40) it's the truth. So let's break down every single method of learning boxing one by one and see which (5:48) really is the fastest way to level up.
By the end you'll understand how this method, this new method (5:54) is 10 times faster than anything we've seen before and how you can literally take what (6:00) you've learned here and implement it as soon as you've finished watching this video. (6:06) Let's start with YouTube, the first place almost anyone goes to learn anything. See it feels like (6:14) progress because there's so much information but the reality is it's actually very different.
It's (6:21) very easy to mistake education for entertainment. A lot of these boxing channels just show you flashy (6:27) clips from fights and it's stimulating like doom scrolling Instagram. But what happens when you (6:34) do this? You forget almost everything you thought you'd learned or you just end up saving random (6:40) clips that you'll never come back to.
On top of that there's so much contradicting information (6:45) out there that becomes almost impossible to know what to listen to and what to ignore. (6:52) I see it stacks up with the categories. Sparring, obviously none.
You can't spar with this method and (6:57) even if you did step into a sparring with YouTube only training you'd just get beaten up. What you (7:04) copy from videos will never be replicated in the ring to the level it needs to be to actually work. (7:12) Then we've got feedback.
You're obviously not getting any feedback. There's nobody to correct (7:16) you and that's why sparring won't work. You need feedback to realise what it is that you're (7:21) actually doing wrong to improve.
Then we've got time invested. It's pretty wasteful. Endless videos, (7:28) no structure, no progression, mostly entertainment.
But some honourable mentions I will recommend are (7:34) Tommy Iancullo with World Class Boxing Channel, Boxing Gems Film Study and for the anatomic side (7:40) of boxing I recommend watching The Punch Doctor and of course this channel. Price is free, you (7:46) can't argue with that. Information quality is abundant.
Yes there's good stuff out there but (7:51) it's buried in oceans of opinion and gimmicks so use the guys that I recommended and continue (7:57) watching this channel as we've got a shitload of great content on the way very very soon. (8:02) Community quality is non-existent. Comment sections and Reddit threads don't count as coaching (8:08) obviously.
So while YouTube might be a good start, the truth is it's a trap. You spend more time (8:17) reinforcing bad habits than actually improving. Next up is personal training.
One coach, one student, (8:26) all eyes on you. Sounds like the dream right? But here's the reality. It feels like a shortcut (8:33) because someone is finally focussing only on you.
But the truth is the quality of these sessions (8:39) depends entirely on who the trainer is. Remember what we talked about earlier about how a real coach (8:45) needs real fight experience, needs to be able to articulate the knowledge and actually (8:50) care about your skill level. Those are rare.
Most coaches are more like PE teachers than (8:57) real boxing coaches like we said earlier. Most coaches who do one-to-one personal training are (9:02) genuinely just there to make money and honestly I don't even blame them. It's pretty rough out here (9:08) in the UK in terms of like cost of living.
Best case is you find a trainer who's fought at a high (9:15) level, can instantly spot mistakes and isn't afraid to crush your ego with constant corrections. (9:22) No touch it even just like this. Just evenly touch it like that.
Can you do that? Can you actually (9:27) touch something like that or like hitting it to an iron? Can you do that? Worst case is you get a (9:32) pad holder who's just there to make you sweat, tell you you're doing great and just take your cash (9:39) whilst you walk away learning absolutely f**k all. Sparring, pretty inauthentic if you're sparring (9:46) with them. You might move around with your coach but that's not the same as facing someone who's (9:50) actually trying to beat you.
It's controlled, predictable and inauthentic. Also sparring the (9:58) same person every time doesn't teach you anything new after a little while. And one more thing, (10:04) you might be being coached by an OAP like I am so you ain't gonna spot them.
(10:15) Feedback is variable. A good coach will catch every mistake, a bad coach will just let them (10:20) slide and you'll end up learning everything wrong like I did. Time invested is pretty efficient.
(10:27) At least you're getting their full attention but then this can vary again if the coach isn't (10:32) actually that good. You're not just wasting your time, you're actively being taught bad habits (10:38) and that can take even longer to unlearn. Then we've got the price, pretty expensive.
From what (10:44) I've seen it's generally about £25 to £60 an hour which adds up pretty quick. But if you're (10:51) being taught by a coach who knows what they're talking about then this is probably worth it. (10:55) Information quality depends on the coach.
Some are world-class and can transform you, (11:00) others are just winging it. So it's worth checking their experience, their ability to spot mistakes. (11:05) Can they actually demonstrate what they're teaching you? If they can demonstrate it then (11:10) they're probably a pretty good coach.
Community quality is isolated, it's just you and them. (11:17) No peers, no second opinions, no culture, no collective growth. So while one-on-one training (11:24) can be incredible, most of the time it's just like doing an expensive bag workout.
(11:29) The difference all comes down to the coach and the good ones are rare. (11:34) Okay, on to method three, the local boxing gym. Pay your monthly fee, join the classes (11:41) and potentially get some good sparring in.
The classic way most people learn. Here's the (11:47) disclaimer though, some boxing gyms are incredible with everything you need to become very very good (11:54) but those are actually extremely rare nowadays, especially the nice looking commercial ones. (12:01) If you really want to get good, you're better off finding the roughest boxing gym you possibly can (12:08) and even then a lot of the real fight gyms still aren't really what they used to be because most (12:14) of the old school coaches have moved on and left it to new coaches who aren't as well versed, (12:21) at least from my experience.
Most gyms, like the personal trainers, are business first, (12:26) boxing gym second. One coach managing like 20 to 30 people means very little individual attention (12:35) and most of the time the sessions are more about fitness than actual skill and that ties into what (12:41) we said earlier, the rise of coaches who are really just PE teachers running boxing classes. (12:47) They can keep people fit but they can't actually teach the art of boxing the way a real coach can (12:54) and that's exactly what happened to me.
I was thrown into spas and fights way before I was ready (13:01) with no real guidance. All I did was just hardwire bad habits, my body's natural tendencies (13:08) to fight, which are very wrong by the way, knock my confidence and made me feel like I was falling (13:13) further and further behind instead of actually improving. Let's see how method three stacks up (13:18) the categories.
First of all, sparring. It's available but here's the catch, most gyms throw (13:24) you in too early like they did with me. Sparring only helps if you're actually ready for it, (13:30) too early and it just ingrains your natural bad habits even deeper.
I remember when I was like (13:36) 12 or 13, I sparred this lad, he was probably 16, 17, 18 and the first thing he did, you step in (13:44) and just went one, two, left hook body, straight to the liver, full power and I just dropped to the floor (13:51) and I didn't even know what I was really doing and the coach just looked at his watch and he was like (13:56) and it left to the round. Then we got feedback, it's limited, you'll hear hands up or good job (14:02) but really the technical breakdown you really need unless of course you build a strong relationship (14:09) with a good coach and only then you'll get properly looked after. Time invested is pretty inefficient (14:18) with so many people most of your one or two hour sessions are just conditioning drills and if the (14:24) coach isn't great you're not just wasting your time, you're being taught the wrong habits.
(14:30) Price is pretty good, I used to pay about £30 a month but I think most boxing clubs cost about (14:38) £50 to £100 a month nowadays and you probably get four sessions a week which is good value (14:44) especially if you happen to find a proper coach and build a relationship with them as I said. (14:48) Information quality is questionable, some gyms have old school teachers who really know (14:56) they are but these are actually very few and far between like I already said. Most just fitness (15:03) instructors in disguise.
Then you've got community quality, a great gym can feel like a sort of (15:10) family, a bad one just reinforces the same mistakes until they become gospel. So while the local boxing (15:17) gym might seem like the obvious option, the truth is you're taking a gamble. If you get lucky it can (15:24) transform you, if you don't you waste years training really hard because it's all conditioning (15:30) without truly improving and honestly I did think any boxing gym would be great but just from my own (15:38) experiences I actually can't believe how common it is to just walk out of there thinking no one (15:44) taught me a thing.
Before I show you the final method let me first explain how I discovered it. (15:52) Back when I was stuck at novice level, losing fights I had no chance of winning, getting stopped, (15:58) just overall being shit at boxing, I decided to start recording everything my coach taught me. (16:05) I'd watch it back, break it down and use video analysis to fix my mistakes.
That simple process (16:12) completely transformed my boxing. It's like looking in a mirror versus being told you've (16:18) got something on your face. When you see it for yourself there's no argument, you just fix it (16:24) but when someone else points it out your first instinct is to resist and question are they just (16:31) having me on or they really mean it which means the fix is less likely to happen or at least takes (16:35) longer.
Within a couple years of using this method I went from novice bouts to elite amateur (16:42) tournaments even stepping in the ring with England boxers and I now have the confidence to turn pro (16:48) next year after taking my best shot at a national title. This same method helped me surpass the very (16:55) boxers who used to beat me up in sparring and even earned me a spot on the navy boxing team. (17:02) Even at GB boxing when I went up there for sparring one time I noticed that they record all of their (17:08) sparring sessions for the athletes to watch back.
The system works at the very highest level and (17:16) it doesn't just apply to boxing. I used this same process to learn how to speak on youtube. (17:22) At first I was terrible but after watching myself back hundreds and hundreds of times (17:27) I could see exactly what it was that I was doing wrong and improvement just became easy.
I even (17:33) used it to narrowly avoid losing my licence and win a court case over a speeding fine by just (17:39) revising what I was going to say and watching it back. Maybe I'll cut that out. I'm telling you this (17:45) is a literal life hack.
By the end of this video you'll leave with a complete understanding of how (17:50) this method uses the exact same process to achieve the same rate of progress I had. Seeing how effective (17:59) this was I decided to use it to coach others by doing the same thing and do something that no one (18:05) else had done before. Online boxing coaching and that's how method four was born.
Online coaching (18:13) the method most people don't even think is possible but this is where things get interesting. (18:20) If you think about how massively CCTV and the internet have advanced society why wouldn't (18:28) you take advantage of that same opportunity to accelerate your boxing progress? On the surface (18:35) people doubt it which is fair enough. They think boxing has to be taught in person but what I (18:41) actually found out is that online boxing coaching takes the best parts of every other method and (18:48) strips away all the flaws.
You get consistent feedback, constant access to coaching, a culture (18:54) of boxers being coaches too, courses with all the knowledge you need far beyond your current level (19:00) and a system designed to prepare you for sparring properly. The best part it's all recorded for you (19:07) to watch back as many times as you want. Here's how it works and how you can implement it today.
(19:14) First of all we've got video feedback reviews of your training. A coach can take your training (19:20) footage, critique, explain and demonstrate how to improve and send you back a video for you to watch (19:27) on repeat so you actually remember what you're doing wrong instead of just trying to memorise it. (19:32) Then we've got group coaching calls.
Unlike in boxing gyms where the coach has to walk (19:39) around the whole gym correcting each boxer one by one, these allow the coach to give feedback to (19:46) 10 people in less than like 30 seconds by just looking at a screen. It's way more effective. (19:53) These can also be recorded for future reference.
Then we've got one-to-one calls for tailored (19:58) corrections, also recorded so you can watch back over and over again. Every session and piece of (20:05) feedback is recorded so you can always go back review and see exactly what it is that you're (20:12) doing wrong and know exactly how to fix it. There's great community platforms now like school or WOP (20:18) where you can create a coaching cultured community where just by typing a quick message or making a (20:25) short video, boxers can coach other boxers so knowledge can spread at a rapid rate.
You can have (20:32) a video course where you can download all the information you could ever need from video (20:39) demonstrations that are structured, detailed explanations so nothing is ever like out of reach (20:46) or you think well how did they do that, how did you do this, you can get it all there in one place. (20:51) Let's see how online coaching stacks up on the scorecard. Let's start by pointing out the elephant (20:56) in the room.
There's no available sparring online but here's the difference. Online coaching either (21:03) prepares you to join a gym with solid fundamentals or runs alongside your sparring at a gym meaning (21:10) you go into the ring ready. It doesn't replace sparring but it makes sparring productive instead (21:16) of destructive and you can post your sparring footage into the community to see where you're (21:22) going wrong.
For me personally every time I've finished a spar I'm looking for feedback, I want (21:27) to know what it was that I was doing wrong and I'm trying to ask people but they don't even remember (21:32) or you know they're not just giving me proper feedback on what I actually need to improve on. (21:39) So having a video and a recording for people to give me feedback so I can watch it and understand (21:46) what it is I need to do wrong and then see it for myself just how like seeing something's on my face (21:50) in the mirror I can actually improve from that spar instead of just hoping something went in (21:57) subconsciously. Feedback is excellent.
Every mistake gets caught in 4k. Coaches review your footage, (22:06) give detail corrections and even demonstrate fixes. Time invested, highly efficient, there's no (22:12) travelling involved, no wasted time, no filler workouts.
Every session is focused on skill (22:19) development instead of just fitness or conditioning. The price is outstanding value similar to a gym (22:27) like your local boxing gym but with exponentially more coaching and support. The community aspect (22:34) and recording aspect means that less time needs to be invested by the coach meaning cheaper price (22:41) per rate of progress.
What about information quality? Well much like every other method (22:48) it all depends on the coach but the thing is with online coaches is they're market tested. Online bad (22:56) coaches don't survive. If the knowledge isn't legitimate the internet calls it out in the (23:02) comments and the videos are never popular and they never gain an audience.
Community quality (23:07) is accelerated. The culture of coaching that you can have in your school community or in your (23:13) WAP community spreads through every boxer. As I've learned from coaching over 300 boxers myself (23:19) I found out that coaching others is the fastest way to learn yourself plus you're not just improving (23:25) yourself you're improving others too.
Progress becomes faster for everyone because feedback is (23:33) just getting out your phone and typing out what you see wrong. It's super time efficient. Of course (23:39) I've yapped for a little while at this point but you probably want some solid proof that this method (23:44) actually works as well as I say it does.
So if you're still struggling to believe how powerful (23:51) this method is here's what people have actually been able to achieve through my online coaching (23:57) platform. Learning directly from me, my coach and the same method that transformed my own boxing. (24:04) These are regular people.
Some who started late, some who had tried gyms before and seen little (24:10) progress but pretty much all of them learned purely from online coaching and in just a few (24:16) months you can see their technique completely transformed. (25:53) One of the best examples is Charlie. He started from scratch online, never boxed before then he went to (26:01) spa at his local gym and the coaches that were taking the spa couldn't believe how sharp he (26:07) actually looked.
They're asking him who's been teaching you, who's trained you and when he (26:12) said he learned it all online they were shocked. That shows how new and how powerful this method (26:18) really is and remember I use this exact same method myself from being a novice with loads of (26:25) bad reckless habits to boxing on the navy team to competing at elite amateur level to preparing now (26:32) to go pro. It's the same system that worked for me and now it's working for hundreds of others.
(26:40) In fact I believe so strongly in this method I know you won't want to leave my online community (26:46) so I'm doing a six week paid challenge whereas an incentive to stay committed you can win all (26:53) your money back by doing the bare minimum. I know that the only way you wouldn't get drastically (27:00) better at boxing is if you don't show up so I'm holding you accountable when you join by rewarding (27:07) your efforts with cold hard cash when the six weeks is done. There's no fine print, no tricks (27:14) just complete belief in this system in my product and I know that when you get the results you'll (27:22) thank me and want to stay forever.
It's truly a win-win for both of us. Check the link in the (27:28) description this video and go sign up now because the offer will not be open for very long.
